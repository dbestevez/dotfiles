# Dotfiles

These dotfiles are designed to fit my terminal-based workflow. Feel free to use
them if you like them.

They configure the following applications:

- [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm)
- git
- mutt/[neomutt](https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt)
- ncmpcpp
- [nvim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)/[vim](https://github.com/vim/vim)
- [ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger)
- [sxhkd](https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd)
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)
- zsh

I like to change the style of the terminal and the applications I run in it
from time to time. Because of this, I keep all style-related configurations in
a separated repository. You can check it [here](https://github.com/dbestevez/themer).

## Installation

1. `git clone https://github.com/dbestevez/dotfiles.git`
2. `cd dotfiles`
3. `chmod +x install.sh`
4. `./install.sh`

## Bonus: Dotfiles-Man's Creed

> These are my dotfiles. There are many like it, but these ones are mine.
>
> My dotfiles are my best friends. They are my life. I must master them as I
> must master my homerow.
>
> Without me, my dotfiles are useless. Without my dotfiles, I am useless. I
> must update my dotfiles true. I must improve them straighter than my enemy
> who is trying to kill me. I must sudo him before he sudos me. I will...
>
> My dotfiles and I know that what counts in this terminal is not the keys we
> press, the commands we run, nor the scripts we make. We know that it is the
> workflow that counts. We will work better...
>
> My dotfiles are human, even as I, because they are my life. Thus, I will
> learn them as a brother. I will learn their weaknesses, their strength, their
> shell, their alias, their vim-like modes and their hotkeys. I will keep my
> dotfiles clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready. We will become part
> of each other. We will...
>
> Before God, I swear this creed. My dotfiles and I are the defenders of my
> environment. We are the masters of our enemy. We are the saviors of my life.
>
> So be it, until there is no enemy, but peace!
