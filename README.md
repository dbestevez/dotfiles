# Dotfiles

> This are my dotfiles. There are many like it, but these ones are mine.
>
> My dotfiles are my best friends. They are my life. I must master them as I
> must master my life.
>
> Without me, my dotfiles are useless. Without my dotfiles, I am useless. I must
> fire my dotfiles true. I must shoot straighter than my enemy who is trying to
> kill me. I must shoot him before he shoots me. I will...
>
> My dotfiles and I know that what counts in this war is not the rounds we fire,
> the noise of our burst, nor the smoke we make. We know that it is the hits
> that count. We will hit...
>
> My dotfiles are human, even as I, because they are my life. Thus, I will
> learn them as a brother. I will learn their weaknesses, their strength, their
> parts, their accessories, their sights and their barrel.  I will keep my
> dotfiles clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready. We will become part of
> each other. We will...
>
> Before God, I swear this creed. My dotfiles and I are the defenders of my
> country. We are the masters of our enemy. We are the saviors of my life.
>
> So be it, until there is no enemy, but peace!
